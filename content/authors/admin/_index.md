We are a university research group dedicated to advanced composite materials and cold-spray technologies, with a primary focus on aerospace applications. Our research seeks to move from extensive empirical testing toward a deep understanding of the physics behind material damage. Through this approach, we aim to reduce the need for exhaustive testing while ensuring safety, reliability, and compliance with aerospace standards.
